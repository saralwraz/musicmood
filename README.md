# Musicmood Front-End

## The premise:

Musicmood is a music matchmaking app that connects users to songs according to their interests and moods. Users can make an account, search for songs, and like them on their profile for later use. If you’re not sure how you’re feeling there’s even a random song button at the top of the home page. [link to ghpages](saralwraz.github.io/musicmood).

## Tech Stack:

This app is proudly powered by Vite and SpotifyAPI. The front end is constructed using HTML, CSS, and React.

The fonts used are Cormorant Garamond and Roboto, both can be found for free on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
